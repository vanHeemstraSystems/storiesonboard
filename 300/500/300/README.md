# 300 - See the wood from the trees - it's easy to have too many stories

As you get into your story mapping, you and your group will get excited and psyched up around your design. That excitement will transform into different potential requirements, more complex routes, different routes and an incredible looking product story map. Youʼll end up with a large number of user stories. Now a large number could be necessary, your design may warrant that number of user stories, or your might prefer that lower level of detail. But, itʼs common that that number is not necessary, and is far higher than the sufficient number needed.

Trust us, having too many stories is not as helpful as it might seem. Priorities will become mixed, themes will get blurred or detail may be too low.
