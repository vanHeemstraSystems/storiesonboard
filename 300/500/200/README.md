# 200 - It's a must you drop MoSCoW

Prioritisation of requirements is crucial. Thereʼs always more that could be built that there is time, resource or money. Using MoSCoW for this too often leads to arguments between stakeholders who have very different opinions of what constitutes a MUST. And they can each justify their position. What do you do? You ditch it.

Use a prioritisation framework or grid, with two axis, labelled in consensus with your group, everyone can begin agreeing on somethings priority. For example, contrast Customer Value on the Y-axis against Technical Complexity on the X. Itʼs suddenly easy for everyone to agree to MUSTs are those in the bottom right that offer the most customer value and the least technical complexity.
