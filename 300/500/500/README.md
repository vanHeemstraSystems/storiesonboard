# 500 - Remember that ideas are valuable

Never remove an idea. Put it into a “wonʼt have” or “icebox” release.

Recycle them and give them value.
- An idea may be valuable when the projectʼs scope is changing
- An idea could inspire teammates to think of a better suggestion
- An idea can show and prove previously tried “dead end” ideas
