# 600 - Involve customers

Involving customers in product development is crucial to enhancing the customer experience and delivering an outstanding product. Whether or not customers took part in the planning stages, walking them through an overview of the story map is a really good idea.

By introducing the anatomy of your story map to the consumer, everyone involved gains a clear overview of the product and its benefits. Once users more easily understand the goals and features of a story map, they can track product development and discover missing or unnecessary features themselves. Managing product design with a story mapping tool gives the product more value to the customer, and since it is always available online, users can review progress and leave feedback.

Managing a backlog in a story mapping tool allows the customer to track current iterations through card statuses. Story maps keep your customersupto-date with the development process, which builds trust and transparency.
