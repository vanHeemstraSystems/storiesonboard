# 100 - Use MoSCoW categories

There are several prioritization methods, one of the best known is the MoSCoW method. Itʼs a very popular way to broadly prioritize the user stories.

The team could easily agree with the four main priority classes (Must have, Should have, Could have, Wonʼt have) and decide the storiesʼ priority. The easiest way to approach the method is to create the four categories (as releases) and move cards into the best-fitting category. You should keep these releases as long as you work on the story map and you can create the final releases above the MoSCoW categories.
