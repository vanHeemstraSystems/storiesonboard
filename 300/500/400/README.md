# 400 - Continuously collect ideas

Ideas can come up at any time in the workstream and the team may not always have time to discuss and prioritize them. Thatʼs why you need to create a space for new stories. You can place these cards into an “unprioritized ideas” release. Donʼt hesitate to put a new thought there and organize meetings occasionally (or regularly) to discuss new stories. This queue-box” is not just for product owners, all team members should be allowed to add their new ideas. Sharing the map online allows the team to leave comments on these new ideas.
