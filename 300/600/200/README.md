# 200 - You've considered MVP, now think Minimal Shippable Product

MVP is probably a familiar term. Storyboarding allows us to see the full picture of a product, then slice it over and over to reach our MVP – the smallest viable version of the Product. This allows us to focus attention and stick to priorities.

A less familiar term may be a ʻMSPʼ – the minimum version of a product that a business is happy for their customers to use. This is likely a larger version of the product, with more features and a longer development period. For example an e-commerce product will have the requirement to take payments, the MVP could be credit card only. But the MSP may require debit and credit card functions.

This is a big distinction, driven by wider business context, its market and environment – if everyoneʼs product takes both payment, a business may simply not be comfortable only offering one. When everyone is in the room mapping out the user stories itʼs useful to understand the differences and align expectations. This way the shippable product developed will actually be shipped!
