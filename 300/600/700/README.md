# 700 - Imagine the map as a system

We know user stories should consider functions in isolation. Story maps should combine user stories to create a journey – or to map the journey! 

This is useful but it misses a level of depth by describing a journey in a linear fashion. As often, the most useful products do not create simple, linear user journeys. Some of the best software actively encourages **loops**. 

Imagine an ecommerce site that focused solely on converting the first product in a basket – thereʼd be no upsell! 

Story maps can be created to show these journey loops. Arrange them by inserting **trigger** and **reference** points.

Get a postit to read ʻreturn to point Aʼ or ʻtrigger feedback loop Xʼ and then on another layer you can map that entire feedback loop. This increases the effectiveness of the story mapping process by being more realistic. Actions have (without being grave or drastic!) consequences and that feedback loop is something story maps should try to capture if they really want to describe the userʼs journey with the product.
