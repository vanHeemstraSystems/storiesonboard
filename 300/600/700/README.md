# 700 - Imagine the map as a system

We know user stories should consider functions in isolation. Story maps should combine user stories to create a journey – or to map the journey! 

This is useful but it misses a level of depth by describing a journey in a linear fashion. As often, the most useful products do not create simple, linear user journeys. Some of the best software actively encourages **loops**. 

Imagine an ecommerce site that focused solely on converting the first product in a basket – thereʼd be no upsell! 

Story maps can be created to show these journey loops. Arrange them by inserting **trigger** and **reference** points.
