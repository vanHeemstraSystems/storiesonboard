# 400 - Come up with release goals

After slicing out the MVP, the next steps are not always clear. It could be helpful to find or describe some further goals for each release.

A goal can be:
- reaching another user persona
- upgrading an existing feature
- improving the user experience
- increase the rate of returning users

Once you ºve chosen your next goal, you can move any related cards into this release really quickly. In addition, there is a good opportunity here to rethink your priorities and rearrange the releases.

StoriesOnBoard offers enhanced release management with release date and goal filters.
