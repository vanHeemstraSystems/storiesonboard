# 100 - Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - is the shortest/simplest way

Collecting all the user stories and journeys is the easy part... but how do we find the most common, most relevant, most needed aspect of work to launch the project? A product can target several buyer personas, so try to concentrate on the biggest crowd, the most simple and common use case of your product. Remember, the user has to complete the journey and reach their goal.Collapse any non-relevant steps to get your MVP.
