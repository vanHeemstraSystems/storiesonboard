# 500 - Give every map section an outcome-based goal

Outcome-based roadmaps put the emphasis on the goal a deliverable is trying to achieve rather than the milestone a team are trying to hit. Spelling out outcomes and goals empowers a development and design team to build a solution, not meet another milestone.

Story mapping is the design equivalent of that outcome-based roadmap. So when you combine the two, youʼll be onto a sure thing. Youʼll have the business onboard as theyʼll be able to see the exact problem youʼre solving for them whilst also seeing the design youʼve come up with to do it. You can do this by using the outcomes goals as story themes and using the linear progression of your story map to achieve more and more goals for the business.
