# 300 - Call out the logical release points

As you始re going through your story mapping process the user journey will start to take shape. You始ll be able to imagine how your product will look and feel and how you can divide work out for the different developers within the team. If you start to wear your Delivery Manager or Project Manager hat at this point, you始ll do everyone a lot of favours.

Start noticing logical release points. Where does a sensible product iteration fall? Could you ship something when it gets to point X and then continue to enhance up until Y? StoriesOnBoard makes this easy to mark through tags. Doing this will add some big value to your wider stakeholders who are interested in the product始s design but also when it could start being used and adding value to the business and their customers.
