# 300 - Retell the story

After youʼve built the narrative flow, ask a team member to retell the story or retell another user personaʼs activities on the product.

This way youʼll establish missing steps. Itʼs a really good idea to get team members to tell the story in the first person. Telling a third personʼs activity can create distance, so break down these barriers by asking your participants to imagine themselves as a user. 

Using an online story mapping tool means you can easily insert a new step between two cards if you need to. 

Moreover, you can rearrange the whole narrative flow by drag & drop (which is much faster than moving cards on the whiteboard!).

Let me tell a story: an agile team wanted to develop a brand new software for cash machines. They wrote all the user stories about inserting the card, entering pin-code, entering the menu, withdrawing the money, etc...

But something was missing. Fortunately, they found the missing part at the end of the brainstorming session. Do you see what is missing?

Yes, they forget to “Take bank card back” :-)

You can check not only the narrative flow but the user stories. If there are no user stories written under a user step, then there is no solution to take that step in the journey. So you need to write at least one user story under each user step.

## Exercise

- Open story map examples and try to find missing steps in the mapped journeys.
