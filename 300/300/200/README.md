# 200 - Think in stories

Forget the features. Tell the story following the logical narrative flow! Tell the story of a user, who goes through your product to reach his goal. If you split this goal into subgoals then you will focus only on a chosen subgoal. For example, if the main goal is to purchase a shirt on a webshop, then the subgoals would be something like: narrow the search with filters, select the color and size, use the checkout etc.
