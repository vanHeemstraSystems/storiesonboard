# 100 - Continue to brainstorm

Donʼt stop the brainstorming after youʼve found your goals.

If the brainstorming team is really engaged with the problem, theyʼll be more likely to be innovative in creating solutions. Continue to brainstorm when youʼre finding user steps and user stories too.

Using StoriesOnBoard in brainstorming mode, you can collect ideas as ʻcardsʼ and decide later where to place them on the map.
