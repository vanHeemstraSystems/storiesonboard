# 1900 - Be aware of accessibility

Design tends to focus on the simplest, ʻhappy-scenarioʼ first. Due to biases this often defaults design to focus on an able-bodied individualʼs journey through the system. Except a lot of people have different accessibility needs. These range from screen reader requirements and text enlargement, to a different platform being the default (e.g. using mobile over desktop) and colour blindness. Building accessible products is necessary.

Consider these requirements at the story mapping stage and youʼll save masses of time through limiting rework. It might also affect your entire design by making you consider the journey from another perspective. Itʼs better to find that change out early rather than half way through development!

If youʼre not sure on the extent of the accessibility needs for your product, check the WCAGʼs guidelines.
