# 1400 - Slice user stories

Prioritizing user stories, or finding the best place on the map can be difficult. This is likely to be an issue when your user story is too big. The solution is to split them into smaller stories.

For example, the ʻsearch boxʼ on an ecom site could be too big a user story when it contains the basic and also extended search functions.

Itʼs called vertical slicing when you split stories by functional boundaries. Avoid slicing horizontally by technical boundaries, because the outcomes are not independent stories. Using StoriesOnBoard, you can use custom estimation units.

Estimations are summarized release by release. You can also filter your ʻtoo bigʼ user stories by using the search&filter panel.
