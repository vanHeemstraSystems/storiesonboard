# 1300 - Look for the unhappy path

Story maps normally focus on the productʼs happy path design. This is sensible, it narrows attention and keeps focus on the productʼs core design. But considering the unhappy path before you need them has big advantages.

First, some error paths are so common they canʼt be ignored at all, think password resets.

Second, bearing in mind some core error paths right from the start will make sure you group user stories correctly and that more accurately estimate the time it will take to develop your product. Finally, and maybe most importantly, if youʼre factoring error paths scenarios in from the start, you will build a better product, because youʼll be able to design a lot of those error cases out, or at least limit their impact on your user.
