# 1200 - Involve your tester

A testerʼs aim in life is to break the code given to them. They are softwareʼs embodiment of the scientific method. For that reason, get them involved early, right from the story mapping stage.

A tester will bring a unique and importantly, different, perspective to the Developer and Analysts in the room. Theyʼll make sure you user journey considers the non-functional needs of the system – how fast do those APIs need to return their result? Do we need to think of whatʼs rendering to the user on the page whilst the computation is taking place?

Testers will keep you on your toes. And whilst obviously you donʼt want to dive right into journey mapping every NFR youʼll need right from the ideation phase, itʼs important to consider them as early as is practical even from a high level.
