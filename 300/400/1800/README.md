# 1800 - Group and theme your stories

You can add more value to your story map by grouping, categorising or theming them as you go. StoriesOnBoard offers lots of techniques to do this by colour coding, tagging or vertically staking them.

Doing it become really helpful when you start to consider how to cut your Releases or the development work. Maybe it makes sense to group things by page, maybe by component type, or you could do it by value to user type. There are a lot of efficiencies to come from good, thorough grouping and it ºs quicker to do as you go, rather than retrospectively.
