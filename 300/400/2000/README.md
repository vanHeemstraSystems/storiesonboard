# 2000 - Mark user stories

As we wrote earlier, tags can be used for several reasons. 

Here are a few examples of what you might use a tag for in development:
- **Risky stories** - sometimes, developing a feature can be risky. Special knowledge may be needed or sensitive data could be involved.
- **Possible barriers** - a barrier could be for example, if your development source is offshore and there are delays beyond your control.
- **Priority work** - i.e. a particular user story is a priority, but development work is on hold as there is an awaited outcome from quality testing.
