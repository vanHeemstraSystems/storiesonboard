# 200 - Look beyond a problem to a goal

User Stories traditionally use the below format; 

```
As a ...
I need...
So that...
```

This format has a lot of advantages. A large one being it lets you emphasise the goal of the requirement, the ʻso that...ʼ part of your user story. 

This is important as itʼs the part that shows how the product will be user by a user and will let you know when youʼve actually achieved the part that adds value to the product.

Writing the ʻgoalʼ or ʻvalue statementʼ shouldnʼt be difficult, and if it is,the chances are the story needs re-thinking as itʼs not screaming user value.

Goal focusing make it easy to demonstrate your story is ʻdoneʼ and to articulate what the team has achieved when stakeholders ask or in your ʻShowcaseʼ. I.e. we added this payment feature so that the customers can make payments.
