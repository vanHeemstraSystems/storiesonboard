# 400 - Come up with solutions

> Brainstorm with your team

The next step is to find solutions for achieving the user steps.

Through this process, you create "user stories". 

Initially, you can use the following template: As a ```<user>```, I want ```<goal>```, so that ```<step>```. 

Using the accommodation example, a users story might be: “As a user, I want to find hotels for my holiday, so I start browsing the discounts and advertisements” or “As a user, I want to find hotels for the next week, so I start searching by date.” 

Brainstorm with your team to collect the most possible solutions and put all user stories under the related steps.

## 100 - Write short card titles

See [README.md](./100/README.md)

After mapping the user journey, itʼs time to collect your solutions or user stories. To keep the good overview of the board, try to write expressive card titles. A smart title helps you to recover the story quickly and easily. Avoid abbreviations as they arenʼt always clear to everyone. Write or attach every other piece of information to the back side of the card.

Online story mapping gives you the ability to attach unlimited details to a user story, without complicating things. StoriesOnBoard limits the visible length of card titles, to keep them short and sweet.
