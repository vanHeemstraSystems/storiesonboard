# 400 - Come up with solutions

> Brainstorm with your team

The next step is to find solutions for achieving the user steps.

Through this process, you create "user stories". 

Initially, you can use the following template: As a ```<user>```, I want ```<goal>```, so that ```<step>```. 

Using the accommodation example, a users story might be: “As a user, I want to find hotels for my holiday, so I start browsing the discounts and adver- tisements” or “As a user, I want to find hotels for the next week, so I start searching by date.” Brainstorm with your team to collect the most possible solutions and put all user stories under the related steps.
