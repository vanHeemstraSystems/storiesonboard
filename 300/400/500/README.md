# 500 - A pictures tells 1000 words

Story mapping is a beautiful technique as it allows us to read requirements as a journey or a full story. This provides a fuller story of the solution weʼre designing. Saying that, if a picture or visual is
available it can enhance your story map dramatically.

Visuals answer a lot of questions in a way thatʼs both very quick and easy to digest. If words can be drawn, they should be. Process flows, whether sketched in sharpies of done to the highest fidelity are great
ways to improve a story map and can easily be added using the add image feature from StoriesOnBoard.
