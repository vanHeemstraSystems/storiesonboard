# 1700 - Make your stories fallible

There are lots of ways to add acceptance criteria to your stories. Whatever your preferred method, consistency is key. Having a reliable format makes the story review and test process simpler in the long run.

BDD or ʻbehaviour-driven developmentʼ is a good method:
- Given ```<X state>``` - e.g. Given ```<a user is logged in>```
- When ```<Y occurs>``` - e.g. When ```<they view the top right of the homepage>```
- Then ```<Z should follow>``` - e.g. Then ```<they should see the dayʼs most read articles.>```

Using this format forces you to double check your own homework – is that scenario reflected in your user story, if not refine it now. Itʼs scalable, meaning, without deviation you can add multiple acceptance criteria by just changing the ʻThenʼ statement.

It also aligns well to automation testing, where before creating scripts, scenarios are conjured to prove or disprove. Using an appropriate format has just saved your tester a lot of time.
