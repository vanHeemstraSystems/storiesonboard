# 900 - Individual stories are part of a bigger book

User stories are a good technique for capturing an individual requirement. They describe a need and how the product should be developed to add that piece of value. Being easy to digest they can be useful for talking with any stakeholder, technical or not.

Linking them together through story mapping fills in the remaining gaps. It creates a full scenario that focuses discussion on a product and service level, rather than limiting yourself to an individual requirement level. StoriesOnBoard allows you to start having that discussion by providing an online, easy to access service, meaning you can remain focused on product value, not displaying the requirements.
