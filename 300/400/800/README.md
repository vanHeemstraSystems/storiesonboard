# 800 - Evolve your information

The board is not just for the user stories, use it for notes and annotations too. User story maps should be living and breathing backlogs. Has a new idea or question come up after the brainstorming? Note and save them
for the next session or meeting to discuss. You can create new stories from these questions and ideas to make things tidy or separate your ideas and questions cards out of the user stories by using different colors
or annotations.
