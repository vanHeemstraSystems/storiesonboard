# 1600 - Don't scrimp on the scenario detail

When we learn to write user stories we stress the value statement, the ʻso whatʼ of the story. This is important as it lets the software engineer know the reason theyʼre doing something. Knowing that lets them tweak the technical solution to better achieve the business goal.

But, another important part of the story is the context. The scenario. Providing more detail there saves tons of time in explanation later on through slack, emails or desk bombs.

3 good ways to do that:
- **Set the userʼs background**; ʻTheyʼre a returning customer hoping to re-order their previous food orderʼ
- **Consider the circumstance**; ʻUsage is likely to be in a loud, busy environmentʼ - maybe consider subtitles
- **Consider their digital maturity**; ʻTarget user is of low digital maturityʼ – maybe consider video instructions?

These are just 3 ways you can increase the calibre of your user stories.
