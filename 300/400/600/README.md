# 600 - Ambiguity is the enemy

User stories want to be specific so that anyone, whether business or technical, can read it and understand not only the requirement, but the need for that requirement too.

You know what they say about assumptions, so donʼt let that happen, instead work to record all of the context and implicit knowledge you and the group youʼre with have. It seems like an effort to specify the
whatʼs meant by ʻclicking the pay buttonʼ but it wonʼt be if it prevents the re-work that would have been required because customers begin complaining that they havenʼt received their confirmation emails,
all because someone ʻassumedʼ that no form validation was required because it wasnʼt specified in the user story.

These items seem like minor details to us involved in the trying to map out the entire journey, but to a developer who has to pick that item up from nothing, theyʼre very important minor details. Ambiguity is always
the enemy.
