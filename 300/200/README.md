# 200 - Discover Project Goals

> Involve stakeholders and brainstorm as a team

Framing the project, and creating clear goals is crucial for effective planning. Project goals are the cornerstones of story mapping.

If you write them effectively, your job will be much easier during the next steps. If you miss a project goal, you can easily miss other aspects of the story too, which leads to a product that ºs full of holes.
