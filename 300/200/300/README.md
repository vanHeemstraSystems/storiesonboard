# 300 - Let your team catch up in story mapping

Although user story mapping is an easy-to-learn method maybe not every team member is familiar with the process. It could be embarrassing to admit it, and those members could participate effectively.

So they ºll be familiar with the method, and all of them can add valuable thoughts.
