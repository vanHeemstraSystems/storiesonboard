# 500 - Use personas for better understanding

User personas are crucial elements of a backlog. They are similar to buyer personas, used by marketing managers to understand the target marketʼs behavior and needs better. The target audience of a product can be segmented by user groups according to their similar mindsets or goals. Each user persona could represent a group acting similarly by using the product.
