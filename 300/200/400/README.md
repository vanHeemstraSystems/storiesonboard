# 400 - Involve the full cast - Think frontstage and backstage

Brainstorming and story mapping of requirements often focuses on the end user, the customer, and rightly so youʼre probably thinking. However, to effectively map out the full story you need to consider the full cast involved in the system youʼre designing and not just the end users. To use a cliché example; the hotel receptionist informs you youʼll be in your favourite room and that thereʼs a balcony table reserved for your dinner as thatʼs what you like. The customer is interacting with the front of stage.

But here the database and analytics informing the customerʼs preferences enable that interaction, that is the backstage design. Story mapping is the perfect time to consider the full design from frontstage interactions to backstage complexities. This is made easy by StoriesOnBoard by through enabling layers of requirements as you go.
