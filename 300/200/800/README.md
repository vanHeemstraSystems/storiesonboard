# 800 - Design for a product, not for a project

We work in projects and programmes. However we design products. Our customers and users interact with products. The ʻthingʼ you are building is what gives them value, not the governance, release frames and documentation that a project brings. We suggest you shift your mindset from one of designing with a deadline in mind as good products donʼt have a deadline, theyʼre used or theyʼre not and good ones are used a lot.

Changing your mindset to realise your story map doesnʼt just describe the next 10 months of work but the first 10 years of a productʼs life will change your approach and your design. Changing like that will let your attention focus on what really matters and enable the story map to em- phasise a user journey thatʼll be repeated and repeated.

It wonʼt just be a map that describes your release timeframes.
