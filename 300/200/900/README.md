# 900 - Remember that business goals will align with user goals

As you story map you始ll be planning our features based on user needs that is supported by solid user research and observations.
You始ll be problem solving as you map the journey path out. But reality gets to us all, and we need to remember that someone is paying for the development and design. That means their goals will influence the construction.

We hope business and user goals align. And a good story map will facilitate that by allowing you to highlight features and user needs to wider stakeholders that review it. But there are times when a business goal does not align to a user始s or priorities will conflict. Now, unless you can prove the benefit of a feature or user journey, you might not have the clout to beat that business goal. That始s when highlighting key factors becomes even more important.

StoriesOnBoard lets you easily call things out by including attachments and uploads or changing colours. Remembering this need and taking these simple steps make it easier to have that difficult conversation with the Business.
