# 600 - Be specific about your User(s)

As a <user>, I need X, so that Y, is a great and powerful format for user stories. As long as the user is specific. A ambiguous user is hard to design for. Stories should be descriptive and specific on the actor involved. They should focus on that userʼs need, not a generic ʻuserʼ Imagine the requirement to view the most read news articles in the top right.

As a consumer of news, thatʼs useful so that youʼre up to date on the latest trends. As a marketing manager itʼs useful because it allows the blank space on the right-hand side to be commercialised rather than being blank. As you map across your board donʼt shy away from directly calling out the user – a logged in user has many different implications to a developer designing secure by default. Avoid them asking you the question, or assuming, and go specific. You can do this quickly with StoriesOnBoard by colour coding different actor / user types.
