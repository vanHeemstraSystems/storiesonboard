# 700 - How do you make toast?

Starting a workshop or story mapping session with a few minutes of ʻgamestormingʼ is a proven way to warm up a group of people.
The game we go for is ʻMaking Toastʼ. Everyone spends a few minutes writing the steps they go through to make toast. Then everyone reveals their own toasting process to the group. Straight away, youʼll notice how different everyoneʼs toast making process is. Some people will get the all the items together first (butter, bread, knife, etc.), others wonʼt even use a plate.

The purpose of this game is to emphasise perspectives – everyone was aiming for the goal of toast, and everyone achieved it, but the journeys were very different. Keep this in your mind as you go through the story mapping process to design a more inclusive and diverse product.
One that meets the needs of more people, overall, increasing the value add of your design.
