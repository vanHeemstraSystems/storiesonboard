# 100 - Involve people in brainstorming

This looks like a cheap hint, but trust us, the more people youʼve got involved in the creative stages, the better. The idea here is thought diversity, and involving people from different teams adds new facets to your thinking.

For example, if youʼre developing a webshop, a tech support team member could deliver valuable information around requests. Youʼd get priceless information from marketing or commercial departments too.

If you want to avoid a ʻtoo many cooksʼ scenario, then organize silent brainstorming or a Crazy 8 exercise.
