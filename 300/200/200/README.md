# 200 - Choose the best-fitting brainstorming method

As described above there are different brainstorming methods for different needs. When a new project starts from scratch the best way is to invite team members to a standard brainstorming and go thru the planning phases step by step. First things first, the team should collect the user goals, then the user steps and the user stories and so on...

As we mentioned in tip 1, if the brainstorming team is too big, and escends into chaos, then a silent brainstorming session could be effective. Create small groups to discuss the ideas, then place the results on the board and remove duplications.

When your task is to improve a running product, there are two great brainstorming methods. 

1) **Reverse brainstorming** is when you look closer at the product features and try to find out which of them causes the biggest satisfaction. This is easily tested by removing a feature and investigating the dissatisfaction caused by this removal.
   
2) **Reverse hinking** is slightly different. This method gets you to ask the question, “How would a typical user use our product?” Then imagine the opposite outcome. Would it work? Why or why not?
